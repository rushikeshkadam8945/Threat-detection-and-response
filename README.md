# 🛡️ Automated Threat Detection & Response 

This simulates real-world cloud security incidents and demonstrates automated threat detection and response using AWS-native services. Infrastructure is provisioned with Terraform and integrates GuardDuty, AWS Config, Security Hub, CloudTrail, and Lambda.

> ⚙️ Designed as a portfolio project to showcase hands-on cloud security and DevSecOps engineering skills.

## Project Configuration Overview
This project includes setup and configuration for key AWS services to build a secure, scalable, and event-driven architecture.

1️⃣ VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)

Creates a logically isolated network in AWS with subnets, route tables, and internet gateways to host resources securely.

2️⃣ EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)

Launches virtual servers to run applications, with customizable instance types, security groups, and key pairs.

3️⃣ SNS (Simple Notification Service)

Sets up a messaging service to send alerts or notifications via email, SMS, or other endpoints.

4️⃣ GuardDuty

Enables intelligent threat detection to monitor AWS accounts and workloads for malicious activity and unauthorized behavior.

5️⃣ Lambda

Configures serverless functions that run code in response to events, such as SNS messages or CloudWatch alarms.

6️⃣ IAM (Identity and Access Management)

Defines roles, policies, and permissions to securely control access to AWS resources.

7️⃣ CloudWatch

Monitors logs, metrics, and events from AWS services to enable observability and automated responses.

### 🔒 EC2 Instance
An Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) instance is a virtual server in the AWS cloud. It provides scalable computing capacity, allowing you to run applications just like you would on a physical machine—but with the flexibility and power of the cloud.
You have full control over your instance from launch to termination, including OS selection, configuration, and software installation.

### 🧩 Security Group
A security group in Amazon VPC acts as a virtual firewall that controls inbound and outbound traffic to and from AWS resources like EC2 instances.
